              <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <h3><b>1.1 General</b></h3>
                    <p><b>1.</b>1.	The following guidance constitutes the Lord
            Chancellors guidance for determinations in respect of an individuals
            financial resources, in accordance with Part 1 of the Legal Aid,
            Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 [the Act], for
            controlled work and family mediation. As in practice responsibility for
            financial determinations in respect of an individual for these services
            has been delegated to providers, this guidance is addressed to providers
             responsible for processing such cases.</p>
            		<p><b>2.</b> Responsibility for financial determinations in respect of
             an individual has been delegated to providers for the following forms
            of civil legal services:</p>
            	<blockquote>
                <p>(a) Legal Help;</p>
                <p>(b) Help at Court;</p>
                <p>(c) Help with Family Mediation</p>
            	<p>(d) Family Mediation</p>
            	<p>(e) Family Help ( Lower)</p>
            	<p>(f) Legal Representation for proceedings in:</p>
            	<br>  <br>
                <p>(i)	the Health, Education and Social Care Chamber of the
            First-tier Tribunal under the Mental Health Act 1983 or paragraph 5(2)
            of the Schedule to the Repatriation of Prisoners Act 1984;</p>
                <p>(ii)	the Mental Health Review Tribunal for Wales;
            	</p><p>(iii) the Immigration and Asylum Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal; or</p>
            	<p>(iv) the Immigration and Asylum Chamber of the Upper Tribunal, in
            relation to an appeal or review from the Immigration and Asylum Chamber
            of the First-tier Tribunal;</p>
            </blockquote>
                      <p>These forms of civil legal services are all <b>non-contributory</b>
             i.e. if the client qualifies within the financial limits these services
             can be provided without payment of a contribution from income or
            capital.
                    </p><p>Family Help (Higher) and Legal Representation other than the categories above are <b>not</b> covered in this guidance, as the Director has <b>not</b>
             delegated responsibility to providers for making the financial
            determinations for such cases. Providers exercising delegated powers for
             emergency representation should refer to the detailed guidance provided
             for certificated work [see Civil Representation - Guide to Determining
            Financial Eligibility for Certificated Work April 2018].</p>
                    <p><b>3.</b> The financial limits and method of calculating
            disposable income and capital for the various forms of civil legal
            services are fixed in the Civil Legal Aid (Financial Resources and
            Payment for Services) Regulations 2013 as amended ["the Financial
            Regulations"]. References to regulations in this guidance are references
             to the Financial Regulations regulations unless otherwise stated.</p>

              <a name="2E-002"></a>
              <h2><a name="2C_002"><b>2. How is financial eligibility determined?</b></a></h2>
               <h3><b>2.1 General</b></h3>
                    <p><b>1.</b> The basis for making a financial determination is
            the same across all forms of civil legal services for which the provider
             is responsible. There are both income and capital limits for each form
            of civil legal services. These limits are set out in regulations 7 and 8
             and are summarised <a href="#2C003">in section 3 below</a>).</p>
                    <p><b>2.</b> Under regulation 5 certain cases are exempt from
            the requirement to make a determination in respect of the individuals
            financial resources. This includes legal help in contemplated
            proceedings or legal representation in proceedings or contemplated
            proceedings in relation to any matter described in paragraph 5(1)(a) or
            (b) (mental health and repatriation of prisoners) of Part 1 of Schedule 1
             to the Act to the extent that the individuals case or application to
            the Health, Education and Social Care Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal
             or Mental Health Review Tribunal for Wales under the Mental Health Act
            1983 or paragraph 5(2) of the Schedule to the Repatriation of Prisoners
            Act 1984 is, or is to be, the subject of proceedings before the Health,
            Education and Social Care Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal or Mental
            Health Review Tribunal for Wales. Refer to the regulation 5 for the full
             list of exempted cases.</p>
                    <p><b>3.</b> Unless a case is exempt from financial
            determination, the provider has, as a first step, to determine the
            client's financial eligibility on information provided by the client.
            This should be done on the requisite form provided by the Legal Aid
            Agency.</p>
            		<p><b>4.</b> The forms must be completed in full and sufficient
            information held on file to allow the determination to be audited as
            necessary. See the 2013 Standard Civil Contract Specification r.3.23).</p>
            		<p><b>5.</b> Reasonable steps, for instance requesting sight of the
            latest monthly pay slip (if the client is weekly paid it is best
            practice to obtain the latest 4 weekly pay slips i.e. to cover the full
            calculation period), must be taken to verify the information provided by
             the client. It is good practice to emphasise to clients the importance
            of giving a full and fair picture when they are applying for funding.
            The client is required under regulation 13 to provide information
            necessary to make the financial determination. See 2013 Standard Civil
            Contract Specification r3.23 and the guidance within s.12 below,
            regarding evidential requirements.</p>
                <p><b>6.</b>Point of Principle (PoP) 59 certified by the Cost
            Appeals Committee confirms that in respect of financial determinations
            undertaken by providers, in the limited areas where the regulations
            require the provider to exercise an element of discretion or judgment,
            an assessor should only overturn a decision that the individual
            qualifies for services where the provider's decision was "manifestly
            unreasonable" rather than because they have reached a different, but
            equally valid, determination in respect of means. This newly certified
            PoP does not override any mandatory regulatory or contractual provisions
             relating to the assessment of means, and continues the approach
            currently applied by the Legal Aid Agency on audit/assessment. Any
            determination that an individual is financially eligible for legal
            services must comply with all relevant regulatory and contractual
            provisions. Providers must apply the Lord Chancellor's Guidance
            contained herein, in relation to determining financial eligibility on
            assessment and any determination that an individual qualifies for
            services which is in direct conflict with this guidance will usually be
            considered "manifestly unreasonable".</p>

            <a name="2C003"></a>
               <h2>3. Does the client qualify financially?</h2>
                   <h3><b>3.1 General</b></h3>
                    <p><b>1.</b> Under Regulation 7(4) for all forms of civil legal
            services the client's gross income must be £2657 per month or less; for
            clients with more than four child dependants (for whom they receive
            child benefit) a higher gross income limit applies (see paragraph 6
            below). If the client's gross income exceeds this level then they are
            financially ineligible for civil legal aid and the application must be
            refused.
            </p>
            		<p><b>2.</b> A client who is "properly" in receipt, directly or
            indirectly, of Income Support, Income-Based Jobseeker's Allowance,
            Income-Related Employment and Support Allowance, Guarantee Credit (under
             s.1(3)(a) of the State Pension Credit Act 2002) or Universal Credit
            automatically satisfies the gross income test for all forms of civil
            legal service. The benefit must be currently in payment (i.e. do not
            passport if claim is suspended) and the client must be legally entitled
            to the payment. If it is advised that the client is in receipt of a
            passporting benefit but there is a clear suspicion that the client is
            not in fact entitled to the benefit, e.g. the client has indicated that
            relevant facts such as a partner, employment, sources of income and
            capital etc. have not been advised to the benefit office, do not
            passport; carry out a full determination of means and include the state
            benefit received as income.</p>
            		<p><b>3.</b> Where an individual who has applied for legal help in a
            cross-border dispute is properly in receipt (directly or indirectly) of a
             means-tested benefit or support paid by another EU Member State that is
             equivalent to a benefit or support listed in regulation 6(2), that
            individual will be passported on income [Advice must be sought from the
            Legal Aid Agency in these circumstances to determine if the benefit
            received is equivalent, this decision is not delegated to providers].</p>
            		<p><b>4.</b> If the client is directly or indirectly in receipt of
            payments under s.4 or s.95 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, i.e.
            NASS support, they qualify automatically on gross income for the forms
            of civil legal services set out in Regulation 6(1): i.e. Legal Help for
            matters described in paragraphs 24 to 30 (immigration and asylum) and
            32(1) (victims of trafficking in human beings) of Part 1 of Schedule 1
            to the Act, Help at Court and Legal Representation before a) the
            Immigration and Asylum Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal; and b) the
            Immigration and Asylum Chamber of the Upper Tribunal, in relation to an
            appeal or review from the Immigration and Asylum Chamber of the
            First-tier Tribunal (i.e. Controlled Legal Representation).</p>
            		<p><b>5.</b> Gross income for this purpose means income under
            Regulation 21 (see section 5.1 paragraph 6 below) before any deductions
            are made  apart from those sums disregarded under Regulation 24 (set out
             in section 5.4 of this guidance) and any housing benefit paid under
            section 130 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992
            or section 129 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits
            (Northern Ireland) Act 1992. This gross income cap acts as a filter and a
             client whose gross income is below the relevant cap must then have
            their disposable income and disposable capital assessed in order to
            determine financial eligibility for civil legal services. </p>
            		<p><b>6.</b> The relevant gross income cap can be ascertained by reference to the table below.</p>

            <h2>4. General Principles of a Financial Determination</h2>
                    <h3><b>4.1 Period of Calculation</b></h3>
                    <p><b>1.</b> The period of calculation when determining income
            is the calendar month up to and including the date of the application
            for civil legal services (see regulation 14).
            For example, if the application is made on December 8 then the period of
             calculation will commence on November 9. In practical terms when
            income/allowances do not vary month on month then the relative amounts
            can be taken by reference to the most recent payment, i.e. the most
            recent monthly wage; where weekly pay slips provided by the client show
            that a consistent amount is paid, the calculation can be based on the
            latest pay slip..
            </p>
            <p><b>2</b>	The calculation period may be varied to an equivalent period
             of a calendar month only in the circumstances set out in paragraphs
            5.2.7 and 5.3.1 below.
              <a name="2E-008"></a>        </p>
            <h3><a name="2C_008">
              <b>4.2 Aggregation of Means</b></a></h3>
                    <p><b>1.</b> Regulation 16 contains a general provision that the
             resources of the clients partner must be taken into account and added
            to those of the client. Partner is defined as:</p>
            		<p> (i) an individual's spouse or civil partner, from whom the
            individual is not separated due to a breakdown in the relationship which
             is likely to be permanent;</p>
            		<p> (ii) a person with whom the individual lives as a couple; or</p>
            		<p> (iii) a person with whom the individual ordinarily lives as a
            couple, from whom they are not separated due to a breakdown in the
            relationship which is likely to be permanent;</p>
            		<p><b>2.</b> This means that there must be a breakdown in the
            relationship that is likely to be permanent (i.e. at least one of the
            parties considers the relationship to be at an end) rather than mere
            physical separation if the partners' means are not to be aggregated.
            Therefore a couple who is physically separated owing to financial or
            practical reasons, e.g. job location or the fact that one of the parties
             is in prison, hospital, residential care etc must be aggregated.</p>
                    <p><b>3.</b> In asylum cases, there may be occasions where the
            client is physically separated from their partner due to the partner
            still being abroad, but the relationship is still intact. In such cases
            the normal rules of aggregation still apply and the client and their
            partner will still be treated as a couple for aggregation purposes.
            However in such cases it may be necessary to consider whether the assets
             and income of the partner, together with any of the client's assets
            that have been left behind, are currently truly "disposable" as far as
            the client is currently concerned. In such cases the provider should
            make reasonable enquiries of the client to determine to what extent that
             income and those assets are available. If it is decided in an
            individual case that the partners income and assets are not available
            to the client and therefore excluded from the assessment then it would
            not be appropriate to make any dependants allowance for the partner
            (see section 6 below).</p>
            		<p><b>4.</b> Where it is advised that a couple are married according
            to English law but are not planning to live together until they have
            undergone their traditional cultural ceremony, you must  aggregate their
             resources in the assessment. This is a change to our previous guidance.
             </p>
            		<p><b>5.</b> Although in general a former couple who are permanently
            separated due to the breakdown of their relationship will usually live
            in separate properties, this may not always be the case. It is possible
            for former partners to live separate and apart in the same property.
            This would be the case if they regarded their relationship as at an end
            but remained living in the same property simply waiting for the property
             to be sold before going their separate ways.
                      <a name="2E-009"></a>
                      <a name="2C_009"></a>        </p>
            		<p><b>6.</b> In addition for unmarried couples, although not
            conclusive it would be usual for there to be some evidence of a pooling
            of financial resources and they must regard themselves as a couple. It
            would not be appropriate to aggregate the resources of say a brother and
             sister, or flatmates who are not living as a couple. Further evidence
            of living as a couple may include joint care of a child of the couple.</p>
                    <p><b>7.</b> However, there is an important exception to this
            rule and means are not aggregated where the partner has a contrary
            interest in the matter in respect of which the client is seeking legal
            aid.</p>
            		<p>Contrary interest in the most obvious sense will mean that the
            partner is the opponent or potential opponent in proceedings. However,
            this will not necessarily be the case  the client and their partner
            could in theory have a contrary interest in a claim made by a third
            party, such as in the case of a mortgagee seeking possession where undue
             influence by the partner may be a defence.</p>
            		<p>In disputes between divorcing or separating couples, whether as to
            children or property, one partner will by definition have a contrary
            interest to the other. However, if a client has left his or her spouse
            and has gone to live with a new partner as a couple in the same
            household, then the means of the new partner should be aggregated with
            those of the client.

                    <h3><b>5.1 General</b></h3>
                   <p><b>1.</b> If the client is properly in receipt (directly or
            indirectly) of Income support, Income-Based Jobseekers Allowance,
            Income-Related Employment and Support Allowance, Guarantee Credit (under
             section 1(3)(a) of the State Pension Credit Act 2002(a) or Universal
            Credit, they qualify automatically on income (by virtue of reg 46(2) for
             all forms of civil legal services. If the client is in receipt
            (directly or indirectly) of payments under Section 4 or 95 of the
            Immigration and Asylum Act 1999  i.e. NASS support  they qualify
            automatically on income for the forms of civil legal services set out in
             Regulation 6(1) for asylum and immigration matters: Legal Help, Help at
             Court and Controlled Legal Representation. All of these passporting
            arrangements are set out in Regulation 6.</p>
            	   <p><b>2.</b> 	A client is directly in receipt of passporting
            benefit, and therefore deemed eligible  on income (however capital must
            be assessed), if he or she is the benefit claimant. A client is
            indirectly in receipt of passporting benefit if he or she is included
            in the benefit claim of someone else i.e. their partner (or in the case
            of a child included in their parents/guardians claim); the client is
            therefore deemed eligible on income if his or her partner is in receipt
            of a passporting benefit and the client is included in that benefit
            claim. Since December 2005 same-sex couples have been recognised by the
            Dept for Work and Pensions and paid for as a couple rather than as two
            single people; passporting arrangements will therefore apply to civil
            partners, married and cohabiting couples (including couples of the same
            sex).</p>
                   <p><b>3.</b> Where the client is not included in their partners
            benefit claim (e.g. if the client is in prison, his or her partners
            benefit claim will not include a payment for the client) then the client
             is not passported for civil legal services. In such cases the clients
            means should be determined and the partners benefit payment (e.g.
            Income Support, Income-Based Jobseekers Allowance etc) included in the
            determination as a source of income for the couple.</p>
            	   <p><b>4.</b> Other tax credits and state benefits e.g. Working Tax
            Credit and Child Tax Credits are not passporting benefits. In such cases
             the client's means should be assessed and the benefit or tax credit
            amount received each week must be included in the determination as a
            source of income (unless exempted - see section 5.4).</p>
            	   <p><b>5.</b> Clients in receipt of the passporting benefits in
            paragraph 1 (except for NASS support) will also satisfy the disposable
            income limit for the  forms of civil legal services specified above, but
             capital will need to be assessed to determine whether they are
            eligible. </p>
                   <p><b>6.</b> Under Regulation 21 income for the calculation period means:</p>
            	   <p> (i) the gross amount the individual has earned, or will earn;</p>
            	   <p> (ii) the gross amount of any entitlements that have accrued, or will accrue, to the individual; and</p>
            	   <p> (iii) any other gross sums from any source which the individual has received, or is likely to receive,</p>
            	   <p> in cash or in kind in respect of the calendar month up to and
            including the date of the application for funding. In determining gross
            income all income must be included whether from employment, state
            benefits or elsewhere, e.g. assistance from friends or relatives (unless
             exempted: see section 5.4.).</p>
                   <p><b>7.</b> Any payments made direct to third parties on behalf
            of the client will count as the clients gross income by virtue of
            Regulation 16(5)(b) of the Regulations 2000. This could be for example
            payments made by an ex-partner as maintenance direct to a third party on
             behalf of the client e.g. ex-partner pays the mortgage on the former
            matrimonial home direct to the lender. When determining disposable
            income the relevant mortgage payment should be allowed against income as
             a housing cost in accordance with the rules for that particular
            allowance.
            </p>
                    <p><b>8.</b> To calculate calendar monthly income, multiply by
            52 and divide by 12 if payment is weekly and multiply by 13 and divide
            by 12 if payment is four weekly. Note: where a monthly amount is stated
            for state benefits and tax credits, this will in fact be a 4- weekly
            payment that will need to be adjusted to represent a calendar monthly
            figure. Universal Credit payments however are paid for a calendar month.</p>

                    <h3><b>5.2	Erratic Income (including the self employed)</b></h3>
            		<p><b>1.</b> Where a clients income is erratic (because of bonuses,
            commission, nature of employment or payment etc.) they may be ineligible
             for funding one month, but eligible the next as the calculation is
            based on the calendar month prior to the application. Where a client has
             received an annual bonus in the period of calculation then this should
            be treated as capital.</p>
            		<p><b>2.</b> As long as there is no question of the client having
            deprived themselves of income (see section 8 below) with a view to
            qualifying, then there would be nothing to stop them from delaying their
             application for funding until the next month. In these situations, the
            client should be made aware of the basis of the assessment and the
            effect of good/bad months. It will be for the client to decide if they
            wish to proceed immediately on a private fee paying basis if on the
            previous months income they are ineligible.</p>
            		<p><b>3.</b> It is important to remember that this situation differs
            from deprivation of income or capital (see section 8 below). This is not
             allowed and the resources which have been disposed of must still be
            taken into account in the assessment.</p><p>
            		</p><p><b>4.</b>The income that should be taken into account should
            include any that is due or will become due for the period of
            calculation. If a client has become entitled to money in the previous
            month which he has not yet received (e.g. he has earned a commission),
            then that income too must be included in the assessment.</p>
            		<p><b>5.</b> In relation to parental contributions to students,
            student grants (this will therefore include bursaries) and student loans
             these should be treated as income by taking the annual payment or
            contribution obtained by the student and dividing by 12.</p>
            		<p><b>6.</b>In the case of a self employed client, it is the level of
            drawings taken from the business for personal use which will count as
            the clients income. There are no special deductions for the
            self-employed. If no drawings have been taken in the last month, or the
            most recent months drawings appear low, then consideration should be
            given as to whether the client is attempting to deliberately reduce his
            or her income for the purpose of qualifying for civil legal services. In
             such cases the normal monthly drawings should be established and
            included in the determination invoking the deprivation rule (see s.8).
            If the client states that they have not taken any drawings from the
            business for their personal use e.g. because it is a new business then
            enquiries should be made of the client to determine how they have met
            their day to day living costs during the relevant period. Any income or
            assistance that has been made available to the client from other
            sources, e.g. assistance from friends or relatives with bills, should be
             treated as income and included in the determination</p>
                    <p><b>7.</b> 	If the client reports that they are to start a new
             job within the month following the date of the application for
            controlled work or family mediation, and the gross amount that the
            client will earn means that the client will not be eligible for civil
            legal services (i.e. earnings will exceed the gross income limit, or
            after relevant deductions are made income exceeds the disposable
            income), it will be appropriate to base the determination on what the
            client is to receive in the next calendar month and therefore to refuse
            the application. </p>

            <h3><b>5.3	"No income" cases</b></h3>
            		<p><b>1.</b> Situations may arise, especially in the
            family/matrimonial context, where a client has not received or become
            entitled to any direct income at all in the preceding month. This may be
             the case where the client is living separate and apart from their
            spouse in the same home, with the client not being employed but the
            spouse still meeting all outgoings. In some cases particularly where the
             change occurred during the past month it might not be appropriate to
            base the determination on the income received for the whole of the
            previous month. In such cases an estimate should be made of what the
            client is likely to receive in the next calendar month based on the
            income received since the change took place. In these circumstances the
            client can be assessed as having no income. If, however, the client is
            receiving money from the partner, or a friend to pay bills or as
            maintenance, this must be shown as income.</p>

            		</a>6. Determining disposable income - allowances against income<br>(figures are monthly unless otherwise stated)</h2>
                    <h3><b>6.1 Dependants' allowances</b></h3>
             		<p><b>1.</b> In determining disposable income the following
            deductions can be made in respect of the clients dependants (Regulation
             25) from 9 April 2018:</p>
                    <p>£181.41 is allowed against income if the applicant has a
            partner (see partner definition in section 4.2). Note this allowance
            applies regardless of whether there is a contrary interest between the
            client and partner in respect of the claim provided their relationship
            hasn't permanently broken down (such as in a case where the couple have a
             contrary interest in respect of a third party mortgagee seeking
            possession of their property but remain together); but the deduction
            should not be made in disputes between divorcing or separating couples.
            If the client is living with a new partner with whom you have aggregated
             their means, the deduction should be given in respect of the new
            partner.</p>
                    <p>£290.70 is allowed for each dependent child (including a
            foster child) or dependent relative of the applicant who is living in
            the same household and is aged 15 or under.(at the beginning of the
            period of calculation).</p>
                    <p>£290.70 is allowed for each such dependant aged 16 or over.</p>
                    <p><b>2.</b> Any allowance for a dependent child/relative aged
            15 or under, or aged 16 or over, will be reduced by the amount of any
            independent income or benefit the relative may receive. Where the
            dependant child's/relatives income exceeds the amount of the allowance
            no deduction will be made, but the excess income will not be included in
             the determination as the client's income. An allowance must not be made
             if the relative's capital is over £8,000.</p>
            		<p><b>3.</b> It would be normal to assume (unless information is given
             to the contrary) that a child under sixteen would not have any income
            but children over that age who are in full-time education or training
            may for example be receiving a grant or student loan, or a wage from an
            apprenticeship</p>
            		<p><b>4.</b> Where a financial determination is carried out for a
            client who has separated from the other parent of the child, you must
            determine whether the deduction for a child dependant can be made (the
            deduction cannot be applied to both parents, even where residence is
            shared). Generally the deduction is made where the child lives in the
            client's household and the client appears to be the main carer of the
            child; the main carer is usually the person who receives child benefit
            for that child, but this may not always be the case. If no one with
            parental responsibility has claimed child benefit, the allowance will be
             granted if the child lives with the client and the client appears to be
             supporting the child from their money. (Note, if the dependants
            allowance does not apply, a deduction can be made for maintenance paid
            for the child see section 6.3)</p>

            		<h3><b>6.2 Tax and National Insurance</b></h3>
                    <p><b>1.</b> The following sums should be deducted from total income (under Regulation 23) when
                      calculating the disposable income for the calendar month:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>(a) Any income tax paid on that income. For the self
            employed, a notional income tax figure should be based on 1/12th of the
            clients income tax liability for the preceding year (i.e. of their last
             income tax bill). If the client either does not have the information
            (e.g. because they have not submitted any returns), or because no such
            payments have been assessed yet e.g. new business, then no allowance
            should be made.</p>
                      <p>(b) Any National Insurance contributions paid on that
            income under Part I of the Social Security (Contributions) Act 1992. For
             the self employed, a deduction of £12.78 per month can be
                        made for National Insurance contributions (the class 2
            payment).</p>

                    <h3><b>6.3 Maintenance paid by the client</b></h3>
                    <p><b>1.</b> In calculating disposable income an allowance can
            be made for maintenance payments to a former partner (including a spouse
             from whom the client has permanently separated), a child or relative,
            who is not in any such case a member of the household of the client
            (regulation 26). An allowance can be made whether the payments are being
             made under a court order, CSA ruling or voluntary agreement. Only
            payments actually made can be taken into account. This allowance should
            be the expenditure incurred during the month of calculation. In theory
            there are no set limits to the amount that can be allowed under this
            heading but evidence of payments should be sought where the amount
            claimed appears unreasonable. Maintenance payments could include simply
            paying an ex-partners household bills or mortgage.</p>

                    <h3><a name="2C_014"><b>6.4 Housing Costs</b></a></h3>
                    <p><b>1.</b> In calculating disposable income an allowance can
            be made in respect of mortgage or rent payable for the period of
            calculation in respect of the clients main dwelling (regulation 28).
            The amount allowed must be net of housing benefit i.e. the amount
            payable as per the tenancy agreement minus the amount met by housing
            benefit.</p>
            		<p><b>2.</b> For clients with no dependants living in their household
            i.e. where no dependants' allowances have been made (see section 6.2
            above) the maximum monthly allowance in this respect will be £545. No
            excess over the amount can be allowed. Where any dependants allowance(s)
             have been made then the rent or mortgage repayments can be allowed in
            full.</p>
            		<p><b>3.</b> The amount to be allowed in the determination is the
            monthly rent or mortgage payable. In practical terms it will not be easy
             to identify separately arrears of mortgage payments, as the client will
             generally declare these as a single revised monthly mortgage payment.
            If the client has already come to an arrangement to pay off arrears by
            increasing their monthly rent or mortgage payment, then, provided those
            increased payments are actually being paid by the client, that increased
             rent or mortgage payment can be treated as the monthly rent or mortgage
             payable in the determination. This is different from a situation
            whereby a client has commenced paying off arrears in order to reduce
            their disposable income with a view to qualifying for funding. Such a
            situation would be regarded as intentional deprivation of income and
            only the normal monthly rent or mortgage payments should be allowed in
            the determination in such circumstances.</p>
            		<p><b>4.</b> Mortgage repayments include the monthly premiums of any
            lined life insurance/endowment policies, PEPs, or other instruments
            which will be used to repay the capital sum borrowed.</p>
            		<p><b>5.</b> Council Tax, water rates, insurance premiums and other
            associated housing costs are not allowable deductions in the
            determination. If there is a clearly identifiable amount relating to
            water rates included in the rent payable by the client then these should
             not be included as rent. However it is not necessary for suppliers to
            routinely seek clarification as to whether or not the rent declared by
            the client includes a sum for water rates.
            		</p>
                    <p><b>6.</b> Where a client indicates they are paying board and
            lodging then only the amount in respect of accommodation can be allowed.
             In those cases where informal arrangements exist, for example lodging
            with a close family member, and therefore the amount in respect of
            accommodation cannot be specified by the client then it should be
            assumed that 50% of the declared board and lodging element is for
            accommodation, the remainder is assumed to be for food and other
            incidentals which do not have a separate allowance under the
            regulations.</p>
                    <p><b>7.</b> Where the client states expenditure on housing
            costs which is more than one third of their gross income then
            documentary evidence (e.g. copy of bank statement, mortgage statement,
            or rent book) to support the figures stated should be obtained.</p>

                    <p><b>1.</b> Where the client or partner is assessed as
            receiving a wage or salary from employment i.e. not the self employed, a
             deduction of £45 for work related expenses must be made in respect of
            each person so assessed. This is a set figure within Regulation 27, and
            it is therefore unnecessary to obtain details of actual expenses, but
            see also childcare expenses below.</p>

            other income received from a person who is not their partner or relative

            deduction can be made in respect of actual monthly expenditure on child
            care incurred as a result of that person’s absence from home by reason

            		<p><b>3.</b>Unless there are exceptional circumstances e.g. disability
             of the child, it would only be reasonable to make such a deduction in

            unreasonable to make such an allowance where one or other of a couple
            was available to look after that child.</p>

             more than £600 per month for someone working or studying full time (pro
             rata for part-time work or study) then documentary evidence (e.g. copy
            of bank statement, copy of agreement/contract with child care provider)
            to support the figures stated should be obtained. As long as evidence is
             obtained he full sum can be deducted.</p>

            deduction shall be made once per determination (i.e. to avoid

               <h3><b>6.6 Criminal Legal Aid Contributions</b></h3>
            		<p><b>1.</b> 	Any assessed monthly contribution from income that is
            payable under a criminal legal aid income contribution order (ICO) under
             the Criminal Legal Aid (Contribution Orders) Regulations 2013 can be
            disregarded under Regulation 29. If the Director has decided that the
            client must pay a contribution from income towards the costs of their
            representation in the Crown Court, this will usually be a monthly
            payment for a period of 6 months and if monthly contributions are paid
            promptly the last payment will be dropped so that only 5 months'
            instalments are required. However, further payments can be imposed under
             the Criminal Legal Aid (Contribution Orders) Regulations 2013 if upon
            reassessment it is found that the ICO should have been for a greater
            amount or the individual should have had an ICO but one was not imposed.
             These payments can be imposed following a reassessment of income, which
             can take place up until the point when the assessment of final defence
            costs is completed.</p>
            		<p><b>2.</b>Where a deduction has been made for contributions payable
            under an ICO in making a financial determination,, a further
            determination may be required when such payments have ceased. (See s.11
            for guidance as to when further determinations are necessary).</p>

            <p><b>3.</b>If it appears that the client has made the final monthly
            payment under an ICO in the month leading up to the date of the
            application for civil legal services, so that no further contribution is
             due under the ICO, do not make an allowance for the income contribution
             within the financial determination; in that respect the financial
            determination will be based on the clients changed circumstances for
            the month following the date of the application.</p>

                    <h3><b>7.2 The client's share of joint assets when the partner is the opponent or contrary interest exists</b></h3>

                    <p><b>1.</b> Regulation 35 provides that the interest of an
            individual in assets owned jointly or in common with any other person
            may be treated as (a) owned in equal shares or (b) in such other
            proportions as appear to the Director to be equitable.  There will often
             be assets which are jointly owned by the opposing parties or to which
            both parties have access. Where assets are held in joint names the
            provider, must assume that the asset is owned in equal shares, unless
            documented evidence of the asset being owned in unequal shares (e.g.
            70:30 division etc) exists and is provided by the client. </p>
            		<p><b>2.</b> In the case of a joint bank account, if the client has
            full access to the money, then the whole amount must be included in the
            client's assets. If the client establishes that there is an agreement or
             understanding about the balance being split equally between the
            opposing parties, then it would be equitable to include half of the
            balance in the calculation. (See also section 7.4 Subject matter of the
            dispute below). </p>

             s.7.4 below for details), a clients main or only dwelling in which he
            resides must be taken into account as capital subject to the following
            rules (Regulations 37 and 39): </p>
            		 <blockquote>
              <p>(a) The dwelling should be valued at the amount for which it could be sold on the open market;<br>

            on the property must be deducted but the maximum amount that can be
            deducted for such a mortgage or loan is £100,000 (this is known as the <b>mortgage disregard</b>); and <br>
            	 (c) The first £100,000 of the value of the clients interest after

            		<p> The financial determination is based on how the asset is currently
             held or registered, not on what each party is hoping to achieve if they
             are successful at the end of the case. So, for example, in a family
            dispute where the former matrimonial home is SMOD, if the client is
            seeking 50% of the property but the property is currently registered in
            the opponents sole name, treat the clients interest in the asset as
            nil and do not include the asset in the determination of the clients
            financial eligibility for legal aid.</p>
            		<p><b> 4.</b> The SMOD disregard only applies to capital assets.
            Income cannot be regarded as SMOD since the issue here is simply whether
             the client is currently receiving the income or not. If income is being
             received then it should be included in the determination even if the
            dispute relates to the level of that income. For example if the client
            is challenging the level of maintenance in payment i.e. seeking an
            increased amount, the amount of any maintenance currently being received
             should be included in the determination. </p>

                    <p><b>5.</b> Equity from property is determined under the
            regulations after applying mortgage and equity disregards as appropriate
             (See Section 7.3 above). In dealing with property assets which are in
            dispute, the following hierarchy of disregards will apply:</p>
            <p><b>Where a client's main or only dwelling (held in sole or joint names with opponent) is the subject matter of dispute</b><br></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Step 1) (a) Apply the <b>mortgage disregard</b> (actual mortgage or
            £100,000 whichever is the less) to the value of the property to
            establish the total amount of equity within the property; (b) Determine
            the clients share of this equity  if property is in joint names assume
             an equal share of the property (i.e. 50% or adjust if a third party
            also owns a share) unless evidence is provided of a different division
            of property. Multiply total equity assessed under Step 1(a) by the
            clients percentage share of the property.</li>
            <li>Step 2) Apply the <b>subject matter of dispute disregard</b> of £100,000 to the client's share of  any equity within the property. </li>
            <li>Step 3) Apply the <b>Equity disregard</b> of £100,000 to the remainder (if any) of the client's share of the equity within the main dwelling.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Therefore, the mortgage disregard will be applied <b>before</b> the subject matter of dispute disregard. The equity disregard is applied <b>after</b> the subject matter of dispute disregard to any remaining property equity.</p>

             stage and there are a range of assets which may or may not be at issue.

            <p>Example:<br>
            The client is aged 66. Total disposable income excluding interest from capital is £90.<br>
            Total disposable capital including property and other assets (after other allowances and disregards) is £73,000.<br>
            Deduct the pensioners disregard in accordance with Appendix 2 of £70,000.<br>
            Disposable capital is therefore £3,000<br>

            <p><b>3.</b> Client or partner aged 60 or over on passporting benefit:
            Where the client (or an individual whose resources are to be treated as

            receipt (directly or indirectly) of Income Support, Income-Based
            Jobseekers Allowance, Income-Related Employment and Support Allowance,
            Guarantee Credit or Universal Credit assume nil income and apply the

             will therefore always apply to a person who is in receipt of Guarantee
            Credit due to the age criteria for receipt of that benefit.

            <b>Please note</b> if both the client and partner are aged 60 years or over, do <b>not</b>
             double the allowance  only one amount of disregard will apply in

            aggregated disposable income is £160 per month, one amount of £40,000
            should be disregarded.</p>

              <h2>8. Intentional deprivation of resources</h2>
            	<h3><b>8.1 General</b></h3>
                    <p><b>1.</b> Occasionally an individual will deliberately
            transfer or dispose of income or assets to another person in order to
            make him- or herself eligible for civil legal services. This is not
            permitted. If it appears that the applicant has directly or indirectly
            deprived him- or herself of any resources or has converted any part of
            his resources into resources which are to be disregarded wholly or
            partly under the regulations, the resources which have been transferred
            or converted must still be taken into account in the determination. This
             will normally mean that the individual will not qualify for funding.</p>
                    <p><b>2.</b> Note that this rule applies where it appears to the
             provider that the person concerned has transferred or deprived himself
            of assets with the intention of reducing the amount of his gross income,
             disposable income, or disposable capital, whether for the purpose of
            becoming eligible or otherwise (e.g. the reason may be to hide assets
            from his opponent). Obviously this rule would not apply if the person
            had lost assets or money without intending to do so (e.g. an investment
            has lost value).</p>

            	  <h2>9. Eligibility of children</h2>
               <h3><b>9.1 General</b></h3>
                    <p><b>1.</b> When assessing the means of a child, the resources
            of a parent, guardian or other person who is responsible for maintaining
             him or who usually contributes substantially to the child's
            maintenance must be taken into account, as well as any assets of the
            child. There is a discretion not to aggregate assets in this way if it
            appears inequitable to do so, having regard to all the circumstances
            including the age and resources of the child and any conflict of
            interest between the child and the adult(s). For example in
            consideration of the age and resources of the child, the provider may
            determine that it is inequitable to aggregate a child aged 17 years who
            is estranged from his parents, living separately from them and who is
            fully financially independent from his parents.</p>
            		<p><b>2.</b> Where a child is a looked after child i.e. the
            responsibility of the local authority, it would usually be inequitable
            for his or her foster carers/social workers income and capital to be
            aggregated with that of the child.</p>

              <h3><b>10.1 General</b></h3>
                    <p><b>1.</b> Sometimes a mistake will be made in determining an
            individuals financial eligibility or new information will come to light
             which suggests that an earlier determination was inaccurate. Where this
             happens the determination can and should be reviewed and a new
            determination carried out which may mean that the individual was never
            eligible for civil legal services. If it is shown that the client was
            ineligible at the time of the application, the provider should
            immediately cease to provide help under the current Controlled Work
            form; if the clients circumstances have changed so that he is now
            eligible then a new application for Controlled Work may be made. If any
            dishonesty or improper conduct in relation to disclosure of assets is
            discovered, the details should be reported to the Legal Aid Agency. In
            such cases the costs incurred prior to such a discovery will be assessed
             in accordance with the Directors externally published costs assessment
             guidance.</p>

                   <h2>11. Changes in circumstances</h2>
               <h3><b>11.1 General</b></h3>
                    <p><b>1.</b> Where on an accurate determination a client is
            found financially eligible for funding by the provider, a further
            determination of means may be required if the clients circumstances
            change. The client is under a duty to report any change of his financial
             circumstances of which he is or should reasonably be aware which has
            occurred since the original determination and which may affect the terms
             on which the client was determined to be eligible to receive civil
            legal services. Such improvements in means, which may include new
            employment, a change of benefits, or a new asset, lottery win etc.,
            should be notified to the provider in relation to any existing
            application or fresh application for civil legal services. </p>
                     <p><b>2.</b> However the provider may decide not to make a
            further assessment in relation to an existing application, if he or she
            considers such a further determination inappropriate, having regard in
            particular to the period during which funded services are likely to
            continue to be provided to the client. For controlled work where the
            determinations are delegated to the provider, a further determination is
             unlikely to be appropriate unless:</p>
            	<blockquote>
                        <p>(a)the clients means have improved dramatically i.e. a
            new capital receipt e.g. the client receives a substantial inheritance
            or lottery win etc of £8000 or more, or new source of income in excess
            of the gross income limit;  or</p>
            			<p>(b)the matter is likely to run for three months or more, after a
            significant change in circumstances. A significant change is an increase
             in capital in excess of £750 or an increase in income in excess of £60
            per month that takes the clients income or capital above the relevant
            eligibility limit.
            			However, it will be appropriate to carry out a new determination
            reflecting the clients changed circumstances in respect of any fresh
            application for civil legal services.</p>
            	</blockquote>
            		 <p><b>3.</b> For example, the client reports that he has received a
            capital sum of £10,000. This is considered a dramatic improvement in
            means, and a further determination should be undertaken immediately.
            Unless the client is aged 60 years or older and on a low income, in
            which case an additional disregard may apply (see s.7.5 above), it will
            only be necessary to review capital and determine that the client is no
            longer eligible on the basis of the £10,000 receipt. Any capital receipt
             of £8,000 or more should be considered a dramatic improvement in means.</p>
            <p><a name="2E-030"></a>		</p>
            <p><b>4.</b> An example of a dramatic improvement of income would be
            where a client reports that they have started a new job that provides a
            salary of £3000 per month i.e. an amount in excess of the gross income
            limit. A further determination of income should be undertaken
            immediately in these circumstances, in which case the client will be no
            longer eligible on the basis of gross income.</p>
            		<p><b>5.</b> Where the client reports a significant change of
            circumstances, (e.g. a client whose capital was previously assessed as
            £7,000 reports that they have received further capital of £1,500 or a

            receiving an additional income of £150 per month, i.e. a sum which takes
             the client above the eligibility limit), the provider will only need to
             carry out a further determination if the case is likely to last for
            three months or longer following the change; otherwise a further
            determination will not be necessary. If the case is likely to continue
            for longer than 3 months, the further determination should be carried
            out immediately and if the client is ineligible, the provider should
            cease work on the case.</p>

             <h2>12. Evidence of Means</h2>
              <h3><b>12.1 General</b></h3>
            	<p><b>1.</b> Rule 3.23 of the 2013 Standard Civil Contract
            Specification provides that subject to the exceptions set out within
            r.3.24, satisfactory evidence in support of the clients information as
            to their means must be provided to you before you assess, and the
            evidence (or a copy) retained on the file. </p>
              <h3><b>12.2 Evidence of means</b></h3>
            	<p><b>1.</b> Satisfactory evidence as to means will need to be supplied
             and a copy kept on file. Examples of satisfactory evidence for income
            are set out at paragraph 5 below. <b>This list is not exhaustive and other evidence may be accepted</b>
             provided it is reasonably sufficient to establish the clients and (if
            aggregated) their partners income during the calculation period i.e.
            nature of income and amount(s) received. The calculation period is the
            calendar month ending on the day of the application and providers should
             attempt to obtain evidence relating to that period.</p>
            	<p><b>2.</b> Where it is not practicable to obtain evidence relating
            directly to the calculation period, written evidence that does not refer
             directly to the calculation period itself may be accepted as
            confirmation of the clients statement of their income during that
            period where it seems reasonable to do so. For state benefits, tax
            credits and financial support from local authorities such as payments
            under Section 17 of the Children Act 1989, notification letters may be
            issued only at specified times or following a change in circumstances
            affecting payment of the benefit, tax credit or financial support. For
            example where the client produces a letter from the Dept. Of Work and
            Pensions confirming their award of benefit  this may well be dated some
             time before the start of the calculation period. In such cases,
            providers should try to ensure that the evidence the client provides is
            the most up to date in the clients possession  such as the last letter
             confirming an up rating of benefit, tax credits or financial support.
            If the notification letter is over six months old, further supporting
            evidence will be required to evidence continued payment (see table in
            paragraph 5 below).</p>
            	<p><b>3.</b>In the case of the self-employed, corroborative evidence
            may sometimes not relate directly to the calculation period. Accounts
            may not have been prepared for that period but earlier accounts can be
            used to back up the clients statement of drawings from the business for
             personal use, as opposed to business expenses, if no more up to date
            evidence is available.</p>

            <a name="2E-032"></a>
            	<p><b>4.</b> Where the income consists of a benefit or tax credits or
            other local authority financial support, the evidence must show the type
             of benefit or tax credit or financial support in payment and where
            relevant the amount. Clearly the amount will be irrelevant if the
            benefit is Income Support, Income-Based Jobseekers Allowance,
            Income-Related Employment and Support Allowance, Guarantee Credit (under
             section 1(3)(a) of the State Pension Credit Act 2002(a)) or Universal
            Credit [or s4 or s95 NASS support for asylum and immigration matters],
            but it is imperative that the type of payment is specified. Particular
            care should be taken where there are passporting and non-passporting
            versions of a benefit (e.g. Jobseekers’ Allowance can be income-based or
             contributions-based); to passport the individual, it must be clear that
             the relevant type of benefit (i.e. the passporting element) is in
            payment. In these circumstances where there are two versions of the
            benefit, a bank statement by itself will not specify the type of payment
             and therefore will not be satisfactory evidence for passporting. In
            lieu of written evidence (including where the evidence provided is
            unclear as to the type of benefit or amount in payment) suppliers may
            telephone the relevant agency who makes the payment, e.g. Dept. Of Work
            and Pensions or HM Revenue and Customs or the local authority as
            appropriate, whilst the client is in attendance to confirm details of
            type and amount of benefit or tax credit or financial support, and
            current entitlement. A note of that conversation including the relevant
            details, along with any unique reference number and name of person
            spoken to, will be acceptable evidence on audit.</p>

            <p><b>7.</b> For capital, the clients statement and signature on the

            documentary evidence of disposable capital must be obtained in cases of
            doubt (e.g. statements for current accounts, savings or other financial
            accounts; independent valuations for property or items of value, share
            certificates etc). In general terms, suppliers should obtain evidence of
             capital if they have reason to believe, whether through previous
            dealings with the client, the circumstances of the case, wealthy
            lifestyle indicators, or otherwise, that the client may have capital in
            excess of the limit or may have acted to deprive themselves of capital;

            of an immigration matter set out in Regulation 8(3)) or £8000 limit (all

            <p><a name="2E-035"></a>	</p>
            <p><b>10.</b> Exceptionally, the personal circumstances of the client
            (such as age, mental disability or homelessness) may make it
            impracticable for any evidence to be supplied. In such cases,
            eligibility can be assessed without evidence. However, the attendance
            note must give the reason why evidence could not be obtained and
            providers must be prepared to justify this on audit if necessary.</p>
            	<p><b>11.</b> Whether or not it is impracticable to obtain evidence
            will depend on the circumstances of the case. Those who are homeless, or
             who are in detention will have particular difficulty in supplying
            evidence. For asylum seekers, there may be a difference between those
            who apply for Legal Help when they have just arrived in the country and
            cannot be expected to provide evidence, and those who apply when they
            have been in the country long enough to receive benefits/vouchers or to
            work, who can provide evidence. It will often be impracticable to obtain
             evidence of income from patients with mental health problems who are in
             hospital (for example, those detained under the Mental Health Act).
            Providers should however attempt to obtain oral or written confirmation
            of the position (e.g. type of benefit received) from the ward manager or
             social worker where practicable. It may on occasion prove impracticable
             to obtain evidence of a partners income, for example where the partner
             refuses to provide the information despite repeated requests. In such
            circumstances the provider will rely on the best estimate that the
            client can give of their partners means for the purposes of
            aggregation. The provider must record the justification for lack of
            evidence on the file.</p>
            	<p><b>12.</b> There may be exceptional cases where a client never
            attends the providers office during the course of a matter, for example
             the client is disabled and cannot access the office so the case is
            entirely conducted via home visits and correspondence. In such cases the
             provider may not be able to obtain a copy of the evidence of income for
             the file. It will be acceptable for the provider to confirm on the file
             that he or she has seen acceptable evidence of income and to record
            brief details, for example type and amount of benefit and applicable
            dates.</p>
            <p><a name="2E-036"></a>	</p>
            <p><b>13.</b> It is important to remember in this context that the
            evidence to be supplied must relate to the time of application, so that
            it is the clients circumstances at that time that are relevant in
            judging whether or not it was impracticable to obtain evidence.</p>
            	<p><b>14.</b> Thus, if at the time of the application for Controlled
            Work the client has applied for state benefits, tax credits or NASS
            support and their application has not yet been assessed, then it will be
             impracticable to produce evidence of receipt of such benefit in
            relation to the period of computation. The supplier should ask the
            client to produce any written acknowledgement of the application that
            they have received and clarify whether there is an alternative source of
             income from which their expenses are currently being met (see also
            paragraph 16 below). Where practicable, the provider should later obtain
             confirmation as to whether the benefit was granted. If it was refused
            on means grounds, the supplier should reconsider whether or not the
            client was financially eligible. The provider should not passport a
            client on the basis of Income Support, Income-Based Jobseekers
            Allowance, Income-Related Employment and Support Allowance, Guarantee
            Credit or Universal Credit (or NASS support where applicable) without
            evidence of a live claim in payment.</p>
            	<p><b>15.</b> As long as evidence is obtained of the main source of
            income, it will be unnecessary to carry on and obtain evidence of small
            additional amounts of income that are unlikely to affect eligibility.
            Where the client is in prison, it will be unnecessary to obtain
            documentary evidence of their prison income (although the amount stated
            by the client should be added in to the determination) as the amounts
            that can be earned are strictly limited. However evidence of wages from
            outside employment will be required for prisoners released on temporary
            license and those on 'working out' schemes.</p>
            	<p><b>16.</b> Some clients will state that they have no access to any
            income or capital. It would be for the provider to decide whether such a
             statement was credible and whether or not it was therefore
            impracticable to obtain evidence of means. However, a note of the
            circumstances should be kept on the file. Clients without any income at
            all are likely to be those whose circumstances have recently changed.
            This might be where, for example, they have just separated from a
            partner and have applied for benefit or have just arrived in this
            country and applied for asylum. The provider should enquire how the
            client is meeting their day-to-day expenses. If a client states that a
            relative or friend is supporting them, a letter from the relative or
            friend should be obtained identifying the nature and extent of support
            (where this is monetary support, amounts must be specified).
